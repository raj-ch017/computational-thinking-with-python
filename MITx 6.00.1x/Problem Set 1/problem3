# Problem 3 [15.0/15.0 points (graded)]
# author: @raj-ch017

"""
Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. 
For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh
In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc

Note: This problem may be challenging. We encourage you to work smart. If you've spent more than a few hours on this problem, 
we suggest that you move on to a different part of the course. 
If you have time, come back to this problem after you've had a break and cleared your head.
